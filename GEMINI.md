- run tests with `clj -T:build test`
- run an individual test with
  `clj -T:build test -n strudel-overtone.params-test`
- leave git operations to me
- be sure to remove extra whitespace on the ends of lines,
  and especially indentation on empty lines
- keep source files to less than 75 characters wide when possible
